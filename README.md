## Abstract:
Cricket score prediction is a challenging task due to the complexity of the game and numerous influencing factors. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting cricket scores using historical match data. The proposed system utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks, to predict cricket scores. The results show that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy and improves upon traditional prediction methods. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in cricket score prediction, enabling data-driven insights and informed decision-making.

Keywords: Cricket Score Prediction, Machine Learning, Data-Driven Approach, Sports Analytics, Predictive Modeling.
